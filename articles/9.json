Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi himself has historically been resistant to foreign boots on the ground.\nAttacks by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab, whose origins, analysts say, are steeped in local political, religious and economic discontent, have steadily increased in the Cabo Delgado province since October 2017.\nThe sophistication of the attacks has increased, too.\nThe ISIL-linked fighters have ransacked towns and gained control of key roadways, destroying infrastructure and beheading civilians. In some cases, they have forced locals into their ranks or held them as sex slaves.\nSince August 2020, the fighters have been in control of the key port town of Mocimboa da Praia, while in March, they launched a coordinated assault on Palma town, killing dozens and forcing more than 67,000 to abandon their homes.\nThe government has deployed thousands of soldiers to Cabo Delgado to combat the fighters, but analysts have long cautioned that Mozambique\u2019s army has historically been weak, poorly trained and underequipped.\n \n\n \n\n\n \nAl Jazeera\u2019s Haru Mutasa, who has covered Mozambique\u2019s security crisis extensively, said the countries that will be involved will most likely be those with the capability to do so, such as regional economic powerhouse South Africa or countries such as Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola that have participated in other deployments in the past.\n\u201cWhat we know from this proposal that was suggested is whatever troops go in, they will help Mozambique [by] perhaps patrolling the Indian Ocean coastline and the border areas with Tanzania \u2013 where some of these insurgents are thought to be coming from,\u201d Mutasa said, speaking from Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.\nThe main question is whether these countries will have enough funds to go through the deployment to Mozambique, she noted.\n\u201cIn theory, every country in the SADC bloc needs to contribute to the standby force but economically many countries are having a hard time because of COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe question now is when will that deployment take place, who the troops are going to be, and what exactly are they going to be involved in.\u201d\n \n\n \n\n\n ", "Source": "Al Jazeera and news agencies"}
