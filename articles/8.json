In some cases, they have forced locals into their ranks or held them as sex slaves.\nSince August 2020, the fighters have been in control of the key port town of Mocimboa da Praia, while in March, they launched a coordinated assault on Palma town, killing dozens and displacing tens of thousands, while also forcing the French energy firm Total to suspend its $20bn LNG project.\nThe government has deployed thousands of soldiers to Cabo Delgado to combat the fighters, but analysts have long cautioned that Mozambique\u2019s army has historically been weak, poorly trained and underequipped.\nThe World Food Programme has warned of a growing hunger crisis as nearly one million people need food aid.", "Source": "Al Jazeera and news agencies"}
