The violence, including the raiding of villages and towns, has killed more than 3,306 people \u2013 half of them civilians \u2013 and displaced at least 800,000 from their homes over the past four years.\nRwanda in July was the first of several African countries to provide reinforcements to Mozambique\u2019s army, overwhelmed by the worsening conflict in the gas-rich province. A contingent of forces from the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is also patrolling northern Cabo Delgado.\nKagame landed in the provincial capital, Pemba, on Friday morning and was received by his Mozambican counterpart, Filipe Nyusi. The two leaders met and addressed Rwandan troops deployed to the province.\nPresident Nyusi welcomes President Kagame to Pemba, Mozambique for a two-day working visit. The Presidents will meet with the Rwandan Joint Forces working with Mozambican Defence Armed Forces in Cabo Delgado, followed by t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate and bilateral meetings and a press conference. pic.twitter.com/5IgFJMRl8f\n\u2014 Presidency | Rwanda (@UrugwiroVillage) September 24, 2021\n\nIn a joint news conference, Kagame said Rwandan troops would help secure and rebuild the areas destroyed by the violence.\n\u201cThe work hasn\u2019t been easy,\u201d Kagame told his soldiers, according to posts on the Rwandan presidency\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cYou have done great work alongside Mozambican troops. You sacrificed and endured days and nights in the scorching sun, heavy rains,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe work done so far cannot stop here. We now have another task which is to continue rebuilding and protecting this country.\u201d\nFor his part, Nyusi called Rwandan troops \u201creal heroes\u201d, adding that Mozambique\u2019s \u201csoldiers are forever indebted to you and we look forward to continuing rebuilding the lives of our citizens for the better\u201d.\n \n\n \n\n\n \nForeign forces have helped Mozambique regain ground in Cabo Delago since fighters linked to ISIL (ISIS) launched a coordinated assault on the port town of Palma in March, offsetting multibillion-dollar gas projects and raising international concern.\nSome local officials have encouraged civilians to return, according to media reports, and the Rwandan military\u2019s spokesman said 25,000 people had been brought home. \u201cIt is very safe for them to go back,\u201d Ronald Rwivanga told Reuters news agency on Thursday.\nBut United Nations officials are not so sure.\nA document compiled in September for UN agencies and other aid groups, seen by Reuters, said it was not clear whether the fighters\u2019 capabilities had been much reduced. \u201cFighting continues in certain locations and civilian authorities have not been re-established,\u201d it added.\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Malcolm Webb, reporting from an abandoned town in Cabo Delgado, said the remains of what the fighters had left behind were still visible.\n\u201cA lot of the buildings have been torched, goods from the shops have been looted, cars have been set on fire as well,\u201d he added.\n\u201cCivilians in this area really fear the fighters from this armed group. They are notorious for beheadings, for abducting people and all of the villages that we passed along the road are still completely deserted.\u201d\n \n\n \n\n\n \nRwivanga said the Rwandans had been moving civilians back into the area they control near a $20bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) project run by oil major TotalEnergies, which was forced to a halt by the Palma attack.\nYet security analysts say the Mozambican military deficiencies that allowed the armed campaign to take hold in the north \u2013 including soldiers that are ill-equipped, undisciplined and poorly paid \u2013 will not be easily reversed. Even with other forces there, they say, security is uncertain outside of small, heavily guarded areas.\nMozambican and Rwandan forces notched up a major victory in August, when they drove the fighters out of their de facto headquarters in the port city of Mocimboa da Praia.\nBut violence has continued. Local people and security forces have recently reported a string of attacks in Quissanga district, south of Mocimba da Praia, where fighters are believed to have fallen back after the town was retaken. The latest occurred on Thursday evening in the village of Lindi.\n\u201cTwo people were killed and another two people were injured,\u201d an unnamed police source was quoted as saying by AFP news agency on Friday, adding that fighters had captured several women and girls.\nFighters also ambushed two buses transporting soldiers later that night, causing at least one death, a traffic police officer told AFP. The attack took place on a main road that had been closed for two years due to similar incidents, and only recently reopened following the arrival of foreign troops.\nIn total, at least 10 people have been killed across several villages in Quissanga over the past week, another police officer said. Some of the victims were reportedly beheaded.\n \n\n \n\n\n ", "Source": "Al Jazeera and news agencies"}
