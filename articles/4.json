Some collapsed under the heavy rain, trapping victims in the rubble.\nBridges were washed away by swollen rivers, while livestock drowned and submerged fields, destroying the livelihoods of rural families.\nIn Madagascar, 110,000 had to flee their homes. In the capital Antananarivo, schools and gyms were turned into emergency shelters.\n\u201cWe only brought our most important possessions,\u201d Berthine Razafiarisoa, who sheltered in a gym with his family of 10, told AFP news agency.\nIn northern and central Mozambique, Ana destroyed 10,000 homes, dozens of schools and hospitals, and downed power lines.\nMozambique\u2019s weather service expects another storm to form over the Indian Ocean in the coming days. Up to six tropical cyclones are expected before the rainy season ends in March.\nIn neighbouring Malawi, the government declared a state of natural disaster.\nMost of the country lost electricity early in the week, after floodwaters hit generating stations. Power was restored by Thursday in parts of the country, but parts of the electric grid were destroyed.\n\u201cOur priority now is restoring power to health establishments, water treatment distribution systems, and schools,\u201d the national power utility said in a statement.\nSouthern Africa, and especially Mozambique, has suffered repeated destructive storms in recent years.", "Source": "AFP"}
